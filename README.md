# Custom Rails Importer

The gem was born from a need for the organization I work for ([CollegePlus](http://collegeplus.org)). We were migrating our systems from one, single, monolithic system into a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) using Rails and needed a way to do this as easily as possible. Thus, **Custom Rails Importer** was born.

#### Currently, you can only import data from a MySQL database. I hope to have this gem be database agnostic in the future.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'custom_rails_importer'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install custom_rails_importer

## Usage
